# Update Plan

1. Refresh dependency lockfiles to capture the new `uuid` dependency introduced with the resolver work.
2. Shore up documentation for conversation UUID migration to reflect RS256/JWKS link tokens and the namespace-based minting fallback.
3. Expand automated coverage for the JWKS endpoint and token backup redirect behaviour while ensuring all token-using tests seed the RS256 test keys.
4. Run the existing Playwright test suite (`npm test`) to validate redirects and token flows end-to-end.
